# coursera-algorithms-princeton
This repository contains programming assignments for Coursera's "Algorithms", offered by Princeton University. Each folder is associated with a single week's programming assignment and contains an Intellij IDEA project. The original project was downloaded from the course website, and the required classes were created and according to the specifications.

## [Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
| Week        |   Name        | Date Completed   | Final Score | Notes |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|  -----:|  -----:|
| 1      | Percolation | 29/9/2018 | 94 | Would need to correct "backwash" to obtain 100 |
| 2      | Deques and Randomized Queues | 14/10/2018 | 100 | Failed to pass 2 memory tests but still obtained 100 |
| 3      | Collinear Points | 01/11/2018 | 99 | Failed one test; duplicates for BruteCollinear. This would be an easy fix. Subjectively, code is not well written and could be much better written.
| 4      | 8 Puzzle | 12/11/2018 | 99 | Failed to throw an exception (since corrected) and failed a few timing tests, all on puzzle39.txt|
| 5      | Kd-Trees | UPCOMING |  | |
| 6      | NO ASSIGNMENT | N/A |  | |
